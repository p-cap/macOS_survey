# macOS_survey
Created a script that has different zsh commands 

# How did I develop it??:
- Took most of the zsh commannds from the reference below
- Put the commands onto an array
- iterate each element in the array through a for loop
- The title of each command was ```echo```'d 

# Takeaway
- Array creation in zsh
- For loop 
- IMPORTANT: The difference between single quote ```'``` and double quote ```""```
